Public Projects by Olivia Ray McCauley

Project 1
Assessing the Impact of Cyclical Noise on Machine Learning Outcomes
This final project report was submitted for completion of the UC Berkeley Data 100: Principles and Techniques of Data Science. 
I worked with two other students (named in the report) to assess the impact of cyclical noise in COVID-19 testing data when predicting 
county-level infection rates with linear regression. I was a code co-contributor, and was the sole author of the final report. 

Project 2
Engineering Homer's Soul: A Mathematical Rebirth of the Author 
Recipient of the 2023 Departmental Thesis Award in Rhetoric. 
This undergraduate honors thesis was submitted to the Rhetoric Department of UC Berkeley for completion of the departmental Honors program.
My work performed a close reading of an authorship analysis study on Homeric texts, examining how mathematical techniques used 
for statistical language modeling express ideological assumptions about language, embodiment, and authorship in the field of Natural 
Language Processing.
